1. Accuracy and Relevance Metrics
-Precision: Measures how many of the recommended cigars are relevant or similar to the user’s original selection. Higher precision indicates the system is accurately filtering cigars that match user preferences.

-Recall: Evaluates whether the recommender is capturing a comprehensive selection of relevant items. Higher recall indicates that it is providing a broad set of similar cigars.

-F1 Score: Balances precision and recall to give an overall performance metric that indicates the system’s reliability in surfacing relevant items.

2. Diversity and Novelty Metrics
-Diversity: Assesses how varied the recommendations are, avoiding overly similar cigars that may limit user interest. A diverse set of recommendations exposes users to a range of options.

-Novelty: Rates how often the recommender suggests new or unique cigars that the user hasn’t previously seen, encouraging discovery.

3. User Satisfaction Metrics
-User Feedback: If you can gather data, track ratings or qualitative feedback on the recommendations, either through surveys or logged interactions.

-Engagement Rate: Track how often users select or interact with recommended cigars, which can indicate how relevant they find the suggestions.

4. System Efficiency Metrics
-Latency: Measure the time it takes for the system to return recommendations. Especially for real-time applications, it’s essential to keep latency low to maintain user satisfaction.
-Throughput: Track how many recommendations the system can handle simultaneously without degradation in performance, important for scaling.

5. Personalization and Adaptability
-User Profile Adaptability: If the system learns from user behavior, measure how quickly it adapts to changing user preferences, which is crucial for personalization.

-Cold Start Performance: For new users or cigars with limited data, evaluate how effectively the recommender provides recommendations despite minimal input.

Example Performance Goals
Precision > 80% for the top-5 recommended cigars
Diversity Score ≥ 0.7, indicating a good range of recommendations
Latency < 1 second per recommendation request
